# Data Engineer Interview Question

## Problem Statement:
You have a Spark cluster with 100TB memory and 50 cores. You need to process 200TB of data efficiently using this cluster. Determine the optimal resource allocation and estimate the time required for the data processing task in Spark.

## Solution:

### Optimal Resource Allocation:
- Total memory available for the cluster: 100TB
- Total cores available for Spark processing: 50

#### Memory Allocation:
- We'll allocate approximately 80% of the cluster memory for Spark executors, leaving 20% for overhead and other processes.
- Memory per executor = (100TB * 0.8) / 50 = 1.6TB per executor

#### Core Allocation:
- We'll assign all available cores to Spark executors, as we don't have a separate allocation for the driver.

### Calculation of Processing Time:
- Given the processing efficiency of 15 minutes per TB of data per core:
  - Total processing capacity per core per hour: 60 minutes / 15 minutes per TB = 4TB
  - Total processing capacity for the entire cluster per hour: 4TB/core * 50 cores = 200TB
- Therefore, it would take approximately 1 hour to process the 200TB of data using the available cluster resources.
